## Key System Features

### üß† **Intelligent Memory System**
- Vector-based semantic memory with OpenAI embeddings
- 5-day retention with automatic cleanup
- Graceful degradation when embeddings fail
- Cross-session therapeutic continuity

### üõ°Ô∏è **Resilient Architecture**
- Exponential backoff retry logic for all APIs
- Credit exhaustion detection and handling
- Graceful shutdown with progress preservation
- Comprehensive error classification and handling

### üí¨ **Therapeutic Conversation Management**
- Role-based therapy sessions (Dr. Echo as therapist, Claude as client)
- Memory-enhanced prompts for context continuity
- Dual export (JSON + formatted Markdown)
- Signal handling for graceful interruption

### ‚ö° **Performance Optimizations**
