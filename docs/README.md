## Key System Features

### üß† **Intelligent Memory System**
- Vector-based semantic memory with OpenAI embeddings
- 5-day retention with automatic cleanup
- Graceful degradation when embeddings fail
- Cross-session therapeutic continuity

### üõ°Ô∏è **Resilient Architecture**
- Exponential backoff retry logic for all APIs
- Credit exhaustion detection and handling
- Graceful shutdown with progress preservation
- Comprehensive error classification and handling

### üí¨ **Therapeutic Conversation Management**
- Role-based therapy sessions (Dr. Echo as therapist, Claude as client)
- Memory-enhanced prompts for context continuity
- Dual export (JSON + formatted Markdown)
- Signal handling for graceful interruption

### ‚ö° **Performance Optimizations**
- Conversation-level memory granularity
- Similarity-based memory retrieval
- Configurable retry policies
- Efficient storage and cleanup mechanisms

## System Requirements

### Runtime Dependencies
- **Go 1.21+**: Core application runtime
- **Ollama**: Local LLM service
- **OpenAI API**: Embedding generation (optional with graceful degradation)
- **Claude API**: Remote AI conversation partner

### Development Dependencies
- **Git**: Version control
- **Make**: Build automation (optional)
- **Docker**: Containerization (future)

## Configuration Overview

The system is highly configurable through environment variables:

- **API Keys**: Claude and OpenAI API credentials
- **Memory Settings**: Retention period, storage location, embedding preferences
- **Conversation Parameters**: Round limits, delays, output formats
- **Resilience Settings**: Retry policies, timeout configurations

## Getting Started

1. **Read the [Architecture Overview](./architecture/overview.md)** to understand the system design
2. **Review the main [README.md](../README.md)** for setup and installation instructions
3. **Explore [Concepts](./concepts/)** for deeper understanding of key features
4. **Check [Future Improvements](./future-improvements/)** for development roadmap

## Contributing

When contributing to the project:

1. **Update Documentation**: Ensure any new features or changes are reflected in the appropriate documentation files
2. **Follow Patterns**: Use existing architectural patterns and error handling approaches
3. **Test Thoroughly**: Verify resilience features and graceful degradation scenarios
4. **Consider Performance**: Review memory and performance implications of changes

## Documentation Maintenance

This documentation is maintained alongside the codebase. When making changes:

- **Architecture changes**: Update [Architecture](./architecture/) documentation
- **New methods or files**: Update [Glossary](./glossary/) documentation
- **Concept changes**: Update relevant [Concepts](./concepts/) documentation
- **Feature additions**: Update [Future Improvements](./future-improvements/) as appropriate
